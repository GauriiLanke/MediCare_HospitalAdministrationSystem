# MediCare – Hospital Administration System

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a console-based Hospital Administration System using Core Java and JDBC. The system aims to automate hospital operations by efficiently managing patient records, doctor details, appointments, and billing information while ensuring data persistence using a relational database.

## Task Description
MediCare is a menu-driven console application that enables hospital staff to perform essential administrative operations such as:
- Managing patient records (Add, View, Update, Delete)
- Managing doctor information
- Booking and tracking appointments
- Generating bills and handling payment details
- Viewing basic operational reports

The application follows a layered architecture that separates presentation, business logic, and data access layers, making the system modular, maintainable, and scalable.

- Core Java
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS)
- JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)
- Exception Handling and Custom Exceptions
- Collections Framework
- MySQL Database
- DAO and Service Design Patterns
- Git and GitHub for Version Control
